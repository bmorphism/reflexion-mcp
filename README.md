## Best Practices

1. Start with either actor or critic perspective
2. Alternate between perspectives to maintain balance
3. Continue rounds until comprehensive analysis is achieved
4. Focus on relevant performance aspects
5. Generate balanced assessments that honor both perspectives
6. Provide constructive, actionable feedback
7. Only set `nextRoundNeeded` to false when analysis is complete
